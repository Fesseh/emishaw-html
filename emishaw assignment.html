Microprocessor is a central processing unit made up of one or a couple of large-scale integrated circuits. These circuits carry out the functions of control parts and also arithmetic logic components.
The microprocessor can complete operations such as fetching instructions, executing instructions, and exchanging information with external memory and logic components, and is the operation control part of the microcomputer. It can create a microcomputer with memory as well as peripheral circuit chips.The microprocessor consists of arithmetic logic unit (ALU, Arithmetic Logical Unit); accumulator and general register set; program counter (also called instruction pointer); timing and control logic components; data and address latches/buffers; internal bus composition. Among them, the arithmetic unit and the controller are its main components.

		 <b>2 Vaccume Tube</b>
		 </h3>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		  ⌨️ <b> Vacuum tube or thermionic valve technology provided the first form of active device used within electronics and they are still used in some specialist applications today. Vacuum tube or thermionic valve technology has been in use since just after the beginning of the twentieth century.
<br>The introduction of thermionic valve or vacuum tube technology enabled the foundations of the electronics industry to be set in place.
<br> A vacuum tube, also called an electron tube, is a sealed-glass or metal-ceramic enclosure used in electronic circuitry to control the flow of electrons between the metal electrodes sealed inside the tubes. The air inside the tubes is removed by a vacuum. Vacuum tubes are used for amplification of a weak current, rectification of an alternating current to direct current (AC to DC), generation of oscillating radio-frequency (RF) power for radio and radar, and more. A vacuume tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating.

    <b>  3 Evollution of Sensors</b>
     </h4>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		 <b> The Internet of Things (IoT) is moving well up the adoption curve, with many industrial firms in multiple sectors implementing and using IoT in a lot of ways.
Micro-sensor implants and biodegradable sensors are also emerging. They join a catalog of unique sensor technology that may be customized for a specific application and scaled to need. As Deloitte posits, a new generation of sensor technology is focused on "connectivity solutions that are more scalable and tailored than traditional wireless networks, which are designed for higher bandwidth, larger volume data devices.
Sensor technology and design, according to Deloitte, will gravitate towards applications. Within each application, new and better technology will emerge to serve them. For example, acoustic sensors "are in development that help recognize audio vibration or frequency to determine activity, location, and intensity," explains Deloitte. .

         4 ARM
     </h5>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		   <b> An Arm processor is one of a family of central processing units (CPUs) based on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture for computer processors. Arm Limited, the company behind the Arm processor, designs the core CPU components and licenses the intellectual property to partner organizations, which then build Arm-based chips according to their own requirements. Arm Limited does not manufacture or sell any chips directly.
Arm is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England.[7] Its primary business is in the design of ARM processors (CPUs). It also designs other chips, provides software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, and provides systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. As a "holding" company, it also holds shares of other companies. Since 2016, it has been owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.
